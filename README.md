<p>
Happy is an application to connect people and institutional shelters. Find one, pay a visit, and make the world a better place.
</p>
<p>
The NLW focused on children's shelters, but as my locality does not have this type of institution, I opted to open the scope and make it available also for elderly's shelters.
</p>
<p>
I used to visit the retirement home in my city. The elderly really appreciate it when people go visit and chat with them.
